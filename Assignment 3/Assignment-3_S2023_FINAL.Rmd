# Question 1 [30 Pts]

## Q1a (10 points) 

Suppose you have a dataset with two variables, age (c(41, 56, 45, 65, 25, 70, 30, 33, 60, 35)) and income (c(93000, 110000, 80000, 125000, 40000, 145000, 78000, 51000, 110000, 69000)), for a sample of 10 individuals. The `age` variable represents the age of the individual, while the `income` variable represents their annual income. Set variables age and income respectively. Then find the least-squares line relating the `age` to the `income`. 

Does the assumption of a linear relationship appear to be reasonable in this case? Give reasons for your answer as a comment.

```{r}
age <- c(41, 56, 45, 65, 25, 70, 30, 33, 60, 35)
income <- c(93000, 110000, 80000, 125000, 40000, 145000, 78000, 51000, 110000, 69000)

lm(income ~ age)
summary(lm(income ~ age))
```

```{r}
lm.income_age <- lm(income ~ age)
fitted(lm.income_age)
```


```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
# The assumptions of linear regression are satisfied as follows: 
# Linearity: The assumption of a linear relationship is reasonable since the variables appear to have linearity. The p-value above indicates that the age variable is quite significant in explaining the income variable. 
# Independence: The observations are also independent of each other.
# Homoskedasticity: Residuals do not vary greatly as shown in the plot below so this assumption is met.
# Normality: As we see in the histogram below the residuals do not appear to be normally distributed. 
# Since this is a simple linear regression we do not test for multicollinearity of dependent variables.
# Conclusion: not all of the assumptions of linear regression are met.
```

```{r}
plot(fitted(lm.income_age), residuals(lm.income_age))

abline(h = 0, lty = 2)
```


```{r}
hist(residuals(lm.income_age))
```


## Q1b (10 points) 
Plot the income as a function of age using a scatterplot and draw the least-square line on the same plot. 
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
# least-squares line plot
plot(age, income) + abline(lm(income ~ age))
```

## Q1c (10 points) 
Use the regression line to predict the income when the age is 38. 
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
newdata <- data.frame(age=38)
  
model <- lm(income ~ age)

predict(model, newdata = newdata)
```



# Question 2 [45 Pts]

Please load the OpenIntro Statistics Dataset - loans_full_schema data by running the following chunk of code.

You can read more about at this link:
   - https://r-data.pmagunia.com/dataset/openintro-statistics-dataset-loansfullschema
   - https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=loans_full_schema
```{r load_data}
OpenIntro = read.csv("https://www.openintro.org/data/csv/loans_full_schema.csv")
```

## Q2a (5 points) 
Display the first 5 rows of the `OpenIntro` data, the names of all the variables, and a descriptive summary of each variable. 
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
# first 5 rows
head(OpenIntro)
```

```{r}
# names of all variables
names(OpenIntro)
```

```{r}
# descriptive summary of each variable
summary(OpenIntro)
```


## Q2b (5 points) 
Calculate the mean, variance and standard deviation of the interest rate of the loans (`interest_rate`) by omitting the missing values, if any. 
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
# mean of interest rate of loans
mean(OpenIntro$interest_rate, na.rm = T)
```

```{r}
# variance of interest rate of loans
var(OpenIntro$interest_rate, na.rm = T)
```

```{r}
# standard deviation of interest rate of loans
sd(OpenIntro$interest_rate, na.rm = T)
```

## Q2c-1 (5 points) 
Use annual income (`annual_income`), the length of the loan (`term`), interest rate (`interest_rate`), and loan ammount (`loan_amount`) to build a linear regression model to predict Monthly payment for the loan the applicant received. (`installment`).  

## Q2c-2 (5 points) 
How can you draw a conclusion from the results? 
   (Note: Full marks requires comment on the predictors)
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
# Q2c-1
multiple_model <- lm(installment ~ annual_income + term + interest_rate + loan_amount, data = OpenIntro)

summary(multiple_model)

#install.packages("car")
library(car)
avPlots(multiple_model)

#Q2c-2

# The p-value for each of the predictors apart from annual_income are quite low so that means that they are statistically significant enough to explain the variation in the installment variable.  
# The model fit is 97.52% so the model fits the data really well.


```

## Q2d (5 points) 

Based on the output of your model, write an equation using the intercept and coefficients of `loan_amount`, `term`, `interest_rate`, and `annual_income`. Then, use the equation for a case with `loan_amount` of 24000, `term` of 36, `interest_rate` of 6.72, and `annual_income` of 90000 to predict their `installment`.  You are not allowed to use `predict` function for this task.

```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
intercept <- coef(summary(multiple_model))['(Intercept)', 
                                            'Estimate']
coef_loan_amount <- coef(summary(multiple_model))['loan_amount', 'Estimate']

coef_term <- coef(summary(multiple_model))['term', 'Estimate']

coef_interest_rate <- coef(summary(multiple_model))['interest_rate', 'Estimate']

coef_annual_income <- coef(summary(multiple_model))['annual_income', 'Estimate']

print(intercept)
print(coef_loan_amount)
print(coef_term)
print(coef_interest_rate) 
print(coef_annual_income)

# Equation for installment
value_loan_amount = 24000
value_term = 36
value_interest_rate = 6.72 
value_annual_income = 90000

equation_installment <- intercept + value_loan_amount*coef_loan_amount + value_term*coef_term + value_interest_rate*coef_interest_rate + value_annual_income*coef_annual_income

equation_installment <- 252.9133 + 0.03029538*value_loan_amount -8.836271*value_term + 8.798582*value_interest_rate + 7.823704e-06*value_annual_income

print(equation_installment)

# installment is 721.7273.
```


## Q2e-1 (5 points) 
Find Pearson correlation between the loan amount (`loan_amount`) and the interest rate (`interest_rate`); and between loan amount (`loan_amount`) and installment (`installment`). 

## Q2e-2 (5 points) 
What conclusions can you draw? Write your reasons as comments.
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
#Q2e-1
cor_loan_interest <- cor(OpenIntro$loan_amount, OpenIntro$interest_rate, method="pearson")
cor_loan_installment <- cor(OpenIntro$loan_amount, OpenIntro$installment, method = "pearson")

print(cor_loan_interest)
print(cor_loan_installment)

#Q2e-2
# Correlation between loan amount and interest rate was quite low at 0.06. It suggests that there is little to no linear relationship between loan amount and installment. Correlation between loan amount and installment is very high at 0.94. It indicates a strong positive linear relationship between loan amount and installment. As loan amounts increase, the installment amounts also tend to increase.
```

## Q2f-1 (5 points) 
Display the correlation matrix of the following variables: 
- installment (`installment`), 
- loan amount (`loan_amount`),
- salary (`annual_income`),
- term (`term`),
- total credit limit (`total_credit_limit`). 

## Q2f-2 (5 points) 
Write what conclusion you can draw, as comments. 
   (answer not included, Please grade on student's comments)
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
# Q2f-1
new_df = (data.frame(OpenIntro$installment, OpenIntro$loan_amount,
                     OpenIntro$annual_income, OpenIntro$term,
                     OpenIntro$total_credit_limit))

# calculate correlaion matrix
cor_matrix = cor(new_df)
print(cor_matrix)

# Q2f-2

# All the variables are positively correlated. 'installment` is correlated the strongest to 'loan_amount' and the weakest to 'term'. 'loan_amount' is strongly correlated with 'installment' and weakest with 'total_credit_limit'. 'annual_income' is the most correlated with 'total_credit_limit' even if it is not strongly correlated. It is the weakest with 'term'. 'term' is most correlated with 'loan_amount' even though it is not a strong correlation. And the weakest correlation is with 'annual_income'. 'total_credit_limit' is strongest with 'annual_income' but weakest with 'term'
# Some of the high correlations might indicate multicollinearity. 

```



## Question 3 [15 Pts]

This question makes use of package "ISwR". Please load `airquality` dataset as following:

```{r}
# or install.packages("ISwR")
library(ISwR) 
data(airquality)
str(airquality)
```


## Q3a (7.5 points) 
Use a histogram to assess the normality of the `Temp` variable, then explain why it appears (to some extent) normally distributed. 
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
hist(airquality$Temp, main = "Histogram for Temp variable",
      xlab = "Temp")

mean(airquality$Temp, na.rm = T)
median(airquality$Temp, na.rm = T)
sd(airquality$Temp, na.rm = T)
summary(airquality$Temp, na.rm = T)

# It is slightly skewed to the left. The mean and median are almost the same. The shape of the curve is also kind of symmetric. This distribution satisfies the normal distribution condition of the empirical rule which states that 99.7% of the data must be within 3 standard deviations, 95% of the data must be within 2 standard deviations, and 68% must be within 1 standard deviation from the mean. 
```

## Q3b (7.5 points) 
Create a comparison boxplot that shows the distribution of `Wind` in each month. Use different colours for each month. 

```{r}
names(airquality)
```


```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
library("ggplot2")
group_month = factor(airquality$Month)

ggplot(airquality, aes(x=group_month, y=Wind, fill = group_month)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_classic() + labs(title="Distribution of Wind in Each Month", x="Month",y="Wind") + scale_fill_discrete(name = "Month")

```

# Q4 [10 points] 
Create a vector x containing 1000 random integers between 1 and 10. Write a script in `R` that uses a `for` loop to count how many of these integers are even, odd, and multiples of 4. Your script should output a message for each category, stating how many integers were found and what percentage of the total this represents. For example, your output might look something like this:

Even numbers: 488 (48.8% of total)
Odd numbers: 512 (51.2% of total)
Multiples of 4: 258 (25.8% of total)

You should use set.seed in the beginning with your student ID. For instance, if your student ID is 500854237, you should write down `set.seed(500854237)` in the first line, and then write the rest of the code. 

* hint: Only `for` loop with `if-else` conditions are accepted.

```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
set.seed(501000900)

# Generate a vector of 1000 random integers between 1 and 10
random_numbers_sample <- sample(1:10, 1000, replace = TRUE)

even_count <- 0
odd_count <- 0
multiple_of_4_count <- 0

# Loop through each element and count the occurrences
for (num in random_numbers_sample) {
  # Check if the number is even
  if (num %% 2 == 0) { 
    even_count <- even_count + 1
  } else { 
    # Number is odd
    odd_count <- odd_count + 1
  }
  
  if (num %% 4 == 0) { 
    # Check if the number is a multiple of 4
    multiple_of_4_count <- multiple_of_4_count + 1
  }
}

# Calculate percentages
total_integers <- length(random_numbers_sample)
even_percentage <- (even_count / total_integers) * 100
odd_percentage <- (odd_count / total_integers) * 100
multiple_of_4_percentage <- (multiple_of_4_count / total_integers) * 100

# Print output
cat("Even numbers:", even_count, "(", even_percentage, "% of total)\n")
cat("Odd numbers:", odd_count, "(", odd_percentage, "% of total)\n")
cat("Multiples of 4:", multiple_of_4_count, "(", multiple_of_4_percentage, "% of total)\n")
```
